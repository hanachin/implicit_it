# ThatsIt

Provide Kotlin's `it` keyword in Ruby.

It's experimental ;) Don't use in production.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'thats_it'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install thats_it

## Usage

You can use `it` method in a block to get a single parameter of the block like Kotlin's `it` keyword[^1].

    2.yield_self { it * it }
    # => 4

    def greeting
      yield "Hello, World!"
    end
    greeting { puts it }
    # Hello, World!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
